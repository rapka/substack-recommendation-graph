# substack-recommendation-graph

An Obsidian vault used for tracking and graphing right wing Substack blogs, with a particular focus on the race science, anti-vaccine, and gender critical blogospheres.

This repo consists of Markdown files named after each blog; each link in the file represents a recommendation on that Substack.

Its intent is to be visualized with Obsidian's graph mode for visualizing notes (to be added). It's my hope that this data will help shine a light on the emergence of these networks of hate.


### Methodology

This data was collected by hand over the weekend of April 27, 2024. Substack defaults blog names to "{Person}'s Newsletter"; I didn't notice any conflicts caused by this, but I may have missed them or made a typo somewhere


### Future work

With a few exceptions, there is currently no data in any blog pages besides their recommendations list. In the future, I hope to add tags on GC and race science blogs to better visualize how the blogosphere works as well as links to the blogs in question.
