# substack-recommendation-graph

An Obsidian vault used for tracking and graphing right wing Substack blogs, with a particular focus on the race science and gender critical blogosphere

This repo consists of Markdown files named after each blog; each link in the file represents a recommendation on that Substack.

Its intent is to be visualized with Obsidian's graph mode for visualizing notes (to be added). It's my hope that this data will hekp shine a light on the emergence of these networks of hate.
